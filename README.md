# BinaryTree

This code contains binary tree class. 
My task was to create two trees and combine them in one, so i did push() method and add_tree() method.
Others methods except printing are used by these two, but also can be used in some diffrent way.
Trees are filled with the random numbers from 0 to 10.
Both trees fill, combine and search elements in preorder traversal, "A" prints in postorder one, "B" - in inorder one.
