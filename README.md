# BinaryTree

This code is about binary tree class. 
That tree is made of sons and brothers, father contains pointer to son (left), son contains pointer to his brother (right). 
My task was to create two trees and combine them in one, so i did push() method and add_tree() method.
Others methods except printing are used by these two, but also can be used in some diffrent way.
Trees are filled with the random numbers from 0 to 10.
Both trees fill, combine and search elements in pre-order traversal, "A" prints in post-order one, "B" - in in-order one.
Also there is some issues in printing because i simply did it through console in a recursive (it's forbidden to use level-order traversal), so it's can be confusing when it comes to printing
